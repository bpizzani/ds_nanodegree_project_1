## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

you will need to download the following datasets in order to run the notebook: [Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017. Kaggle. ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017)

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What's the share and background of women in tech?

2. How average salary compares for Man and Woman based on formal education?

3. Does your Major affects your salary?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. One of them is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual questions. The second one, utils.py contains some useful functions to use along the notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [HERE](https://medium.com/@bpizzani92/how-gender-and-background-affects-developers-salary-19a89b9eca5e)
 
## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
