## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What education does different gender choose to break in the tech world ?

2. What is the salary average by gender of the tech professionals?

3. Which formal educations in the tech world provide higher salaries for woman and other genders?

4. What are the salary ranges according to different professional race backgrounds

Dataset source: [Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017. Kaggle. ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017)


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. One of them is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual questions. The second one, utils.py contains some useful functions to use along the notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available HERE
